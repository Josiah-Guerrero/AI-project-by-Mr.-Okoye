    This piece of code is meant to represent a prototype of what will be the login portion of my IA. 
    A thought I had on hand was that it seemed difficult to find a way to set a new password constantly for each new teacher, so what if I made one they each had access to. 
    In this code, teachers have to input three different digit passwords before they can move on, that way if a student responded "YES" to being a teacher, 
    they'd be stopped by the needed passwords, and if any are failed, they are forced to either leave or try again. My plan is to use this on a much wider scale, 
    setting similar tests up for individual classes, for example, Biology, English, Math, History, etc. Then set passwords that each teacher will have to answer before 
    they can access the students grades, then I will set up a seperate test for students themselves to soley view.
    
    I benefited from some old pieces of code I solved awhile back and edited the format to fit my project, while avoiding direct use of copying.
